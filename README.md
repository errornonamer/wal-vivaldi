# OUTDATED

This script has been broken for a while and I have no plan on updating it as I don't use pywal anymore

# wal-vivaldi

small script that generates custom CSS for Vivaldi from colors.json generated by pywal

## installation

1. enable CSS modification
    1. go to vivaldi://experiments
    2. toggle "Allow for using CSS modifications"
2. apply resource patch
    1. make scripts executable with `chmod +x *.py`
    2. run `install.py`
    * after every Vivaldi update, run `patcher.py` as root
    * after every pywal color scheme update (eg. with [dwall](https://github.com/adi1090x/dynamic-wallpaper)) run `generator.py`
3. set wal-vivaldi folder as custom CSS directory
    1. open settings
